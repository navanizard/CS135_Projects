question: What possible numbers does 1 + rand() % 7 generate?
answer: [1, 7]
explanation: rand()%7 generates a random int in [0, 6]. 1 + rand() % 7 generates a random int in [1, 7].

question: What is the value of (4 + 7 % 3) / 2 in C++?
answer: 2
explanation: division operator % has higher precedence than addition operator +. So % runs first in 4 + 7 % 3. 
Note that 7 % 3 is 1, after it adds with 4, the sum is 5. When 5 is divided by 2, the quotient is 2.

question: Write header of a function called min, given an array of characters (type char) with size many elements, 
return the smallest ASCII code of all the elements in the array.
answer: int min(char* arr, int size); 
explanation: also int min(char arr[], int size);

question: Declare class Coord as follows:
    class Coord {
        public:
            double x;
            double y;
    };
Declare a Coord object point and initialize its x as 2 and y as 3.
answer: Coord point = {2, 3};
explanation: or Coord point{2, 3}; or Coord point; point.x = 2; point.y = 3;

question: Given the following code segment.
    void foo(string *ps, string *pt);
    int main() {
        string s = "hello";
        string t = "hi";
        //TODO: write a statement to call foo using appropriate attributes of s and t.
        return 0;
    }

question: Suppose we have main function defined as follows. And calling foo(m, n), 
the values of m and n are swapped. That is, m becomes 2 and n becomes 1.
    int main() {
        int m = 1;
        int n = 2;
        foo(m, n);
        return 0;
    }
What is the header of function foo? Suppose its return type is void.
answer: void foo(int& m, int& n); 
explanation: //note that & after int cannot be omitted and it means pass by reference.

label: 1.10
type: pass by reference
