# CSCI 135 - Analysis & Design 1 (C++)

## Overview
This repository contains source code and projects I completed as part of **CSCI 13500 - Analysis & Design 1** at **Hunter College** during the **Spring 2025** semester. The coursework focused on software analysis and design, with a primary emphasis on learning C++ programming. Topics covered included basic programming principles, data structures, algorithmic design, and an introduction to software development techniques.

## What I Learned
Throughout the semester, I worked on projects that strengthened my ability to:
- Write C++ programs utilizing loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.
- Implement and understand fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, and stacks.
- Apply algorithmic concepts such as sorting (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort) and searching (e.g., binary search).
- Develop a strong understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Design and implement solutions to complex problems through modular software design.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms to optimize performance.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** (for all programming assignments and projects)
- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C++ code)
- **Linux** (for development environment and command-line tools)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism)
- **Algorithms** (Sorting, searching, and optimization techniques)
- **Data Structures** (Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues)

## Notes
This repository reflects my learning experience in CSCI 13500. Through various assignments and projects, I gained a solid foundation in C++ and software design. The course has enhanced my problem-solving skills and my ability to write clean, efficient code.
